        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>My name is M. Rajavardhan, and I am a 2nd-year Computer Science and Engineering student at IIT
                    Indore. I have
                    a strong interest in database management and data structures. My studies have helped me develop
                    important
                    skills in problem-solving and analytical thinking. I am passionate about learning more about how
                    data is
                    organized and used in technology, and I look forward to improving my knowledge in these areas.
                    As I continue to deepen my understanding of these subjects, I am eager to apply my learning in
                    real-world contexts. I am especially interested in exploring the optimization of data systems for
                    enhanced efficiency and reliability. My curiosity about technology keeps me engaged in learning
                    about new trends and advancements, which I hope will enable me to contribute to impactful projects
                    in the future.

                    With a focus on continuous growth, both academically and professionally, I aim to develop the skills
                    necessary to tackle complex challenges and make meaningful contributions to the tech world.</p>

                <h3>Database Management System</h3>
                <p>I'm currently working on a DBMS project called "Supermarket Management System." This project
                    involves designing and implementing a database to manage inventory, sales, and customer data for
                    a supermarket. The goal is to create an efficient system that tracks stock levels, records
                    transactions, and generates reports to help streamline supermarket operations. Through this
                    project, I'm gaining hands-on experience with database design, SQL queries, and data management.
